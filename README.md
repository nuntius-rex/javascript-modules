# Javascript Modules
Examples of various kinds of JavaScript modules.

JavaScript has been in a state of growth with respect to modular design over the years.
Often this has created some confusion over which module type we should be using.
Very often, if we are not creating from scratch, we may be relegated to using the code structure the library we are using requires.
Yet, a newer modern structure has emerged.

This repo contains some examples of the various types of modules you might encounter.

## IIFF - Immediately Invoked Function Expression  

A native module design that leverages the extreme flexibility of JavaScript functions to encapsulate code.
